# User Info Fwd Bot

Inspired by https://github.com/nadam/userinfobot/blob/master/src/main/java/se/anyro/userinfobot/UserInfoServlet.java

[Userinfofwdbot](https://telegram.me/userinfofwdbot) is a simple [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org) bot displaying user info when a message is forwarded to it. Mainly used for finding the user id.

It improves on the original by displaying the user's ID from more forwarded sources of messages, such as group chats in addition to channels. Other than that, it's not much different.

The bot is written for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
